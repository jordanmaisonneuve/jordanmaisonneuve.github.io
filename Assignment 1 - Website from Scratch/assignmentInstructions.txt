n objectives of this assignment are:

to design a simple website by manually crafting HTML and CSS, and

to publish the website.


Requirements:
The website must consist of at least 4 different pages, including a top-level page.

All pages must share the same external style sheet.

It must be possible to navigate between the pages:

it should not be possible to get stuck on any page;

ideally you will provide direct access to any page using some content navigation table/list on every page;
at minimum every page will include a link to the top page.

Every page must include at least one picture.

Your site must use (at least once) the following HTML elements:

table, nicely styled with CSS; and
list (ordered or unordered).

The whole site must look pretty (font, layout, color theme). Once you select a topic for a website, you can get inspiration by looking for that topic on the web.
Your assignment must be publicly viewable. That means you must host it on a publicly available web server. We discussed some free hosting choices in the class.

All files (html & css) must be written by hand (manually). You cannot use an application to auto-generate your html or css, e.g. you cannot use MS Word to export html/css.

The html/css must be nicely formatted, so that a human can easily read it.

Make sure your site works as intended in at least the following desktop browsers: Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

You are not allowed to use any library for this assignment!
